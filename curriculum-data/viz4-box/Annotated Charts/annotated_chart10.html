``` In this modified version of the chart, the title has been changed to
"Real-world Applications and Limitations of Box Plots" to reflect the topic of
the explanation. The box plots now show all the data points (boxpoints: 'all')
with a certain amount of jitter and point position to avoid overlap. An
annotation has been added to highlight the central tendency and dispersion of
moisture levels in the crops on the first day. The color of the annotation is
red as specified.
