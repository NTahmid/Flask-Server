  "10": "Analyzing multivariate scatter plots involves examining the relationships between three or more variables by plotting them in a two-dimensional space, with the addition of visual cues such as color, shape, or size to represent additional dimensions. In the context of the provided chart, which displays professional cycling data, the primary variables are the cyclists' completion times and the years in which they competed. Each point on the scatter plot represents an individual cyclist's performance, with the x-axis indicating the year of the race and the y-axis showing the time taken to complete the course. The color of the points is used as a third variable to distinguish between cyclists with and without doping allegations, allowing for a deeper analysis of the data. For example, one might observe clusters of colored points to identify patterns or trends related to doping allegations over time. By examining the scatter plot, one can draw insights such as whether cyclists with doping allegations tend to have faster completion times or if there are particular years with a higher concentration of doping cases. The multivariate nature of the scatter plot enriches the analysis by enabling the simultaneous consideration of performance, time, and ethical considerations within the sport."
